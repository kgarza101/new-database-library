In order for the database to read/run do the following:
    
Nagivate to the folder with all the code, and ours is under:
        
        "cd new-database-library"

After that run the text file first and then the python file to run the app.
       
        "pip install requirements.txt"
        "python app.py"

This should allow the webserver to start, the click to it should be in the terminal.
