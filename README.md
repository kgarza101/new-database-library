In order for the database to read/run do the following:
    
Nagivate to the folder with all the code, and ours is under:
        
        "cd database-library"

After that run the python file in the termnial:
       
        "python library_app.py"

This should allow the library.db to be read without error, but you have to run the python file in the terminal instead of the Run Code button on VS
