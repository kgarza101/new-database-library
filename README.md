In order for the database to read/run do the following:
    
Nagivate to the folder with all the code, and ours is under:
        
        "cd new-database-library"

After that run the python file in the termnial:
       
        "python app.py"

This should allow the login.db to be read without error, but you have to run the python file in the terminal instead of the Run Code button on VS
login.py starts first and the features for login in or registering should appear.
